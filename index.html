        <p> I like french toast alot. I dont know if you can tell, really. </p>
        <p>Honestly, for much of childhood it was <i>the</i> breakfast staple. Breakfast without french toast was like waking up without opening your eyes first: it just wasn't possible. As the years went by, alot of things changed in my life; my school, my family and even me. I'm not the same 5 year old kid who'd wake up at 8 am before school to watch <i>Dora the explorer</I> while muching on French toast with some milk. Nor am I the 12 year old who would use the same knife to spread the jam and butter on my slice. No no, I would never do that now. It feels like a crime, ugh. </p>
        <p>I still love French toast the same, though. Often when I'm rushing to get ready in the morning, I completely forget about breakfast. Then I get a whiff of a certain eggy and sweet scent, and comically float over to the kitchen to eat my two slices of toast with some <i>chai</i>.</p>

        <p>I wrote a poem once as a kid about how much I love french toast. It was for some assignment related to English in like...class 5 I'd say? It was a really cool poem. I'd share it here, but i forgot the poem. Completely. Oh, why'd I mention it here then? Ummm....because I think it'd be an injustice for that wonderful poem to be forgotten by me. So by telling you that such a poem existed once, the <i>idea</i> of the poem will live on.</p>
